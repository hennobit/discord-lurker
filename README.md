# Discord Lurker  
# Overview: 
Discord Lurker is a Python-based bot designed to lurk in a Discord server and collect various data. Currently, it supports a single server, but future updates aim to expand this to multiple servers.
The project includes a web interface and utilizes an SQLite database for data storage.  
# Features: 
Voice Channel Time Tracking: Discord Lurker records the time users spend in voice channels, offering insights into user activity and engagement. 
Online Status Monitoring: It also tracks the different online status of server members, providing real-time information about their availability. 
# Future Enhancements: 
In the upcoming versions, I plan to add more features and data collection capabilities, such as message statistics, user interactions, and more. Discord Lurker will evolve to be a comprehensive tool for server administrators and analysts.
